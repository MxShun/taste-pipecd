  - for **Kubernetes**:
    - You have a Kubernetes cluster.
    - You can connect the cluster with kubectl.
  - for **Google Cloud Run**:
    - You can call Cloud Run APIs from you local to your Google Cloud project.
  - for **Amazon ECS**:
    - You can call APIs of [ECS](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ecs/index.html) and [ELBv2](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/elbv2/index.html) from your local to your AWS account.

      - two subnets where the service will be placed
      - a security group which allows `HTTP:80` inbound from your local
      - a task execution role which has [`AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy.html). See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html).
